description: "The romance novel or romantic novel discussed in this article is the\
  \ mass-market literary genre. Novels of this type of genre fiction place their primary\
  \ focus on the relationship and romantic love between two people, and must have\
  \ an \"emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending.\" There are many subgenres\
  \ of the romance novel including fantasy, historical romance, paranormal fiction,\
  \ and science fiction. Walter Scott defined the literary fiction form of romance\
  \ as \"a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon\
  \ marvellous and uncommon incidents\".\nA thriving genre of works conventionally\
  \ referred to as \"romance novels\" existed in ancient Greece. Some scholars see\
  \ precursors to modern genre fiction romance novels in literary fiction of the 18th\
  \ and 19th centuries, including Samuel Richardson's sentimental novel Pamela, or\
  \ Virtue Rewarded (1740) and the novels of Jane Austen.\nAusten inspired Georgette\
  \ Heyer, the British author of historical romance set around the time Austen lived,\
  \ as well as detective fiction, who technically created the subgenre Regency Romance.\
  \ Heyer's first romance novel, The Black Moth (1921), was set in 1751.\nThe British\
  \ company Mills and Boon began releasing escapist fiction for women in the 1930s.\
  \ Their books were sold in North America by Harlequin Enterprises Ltd, which began\
  \ direct marketing to readers and allowing mass-market merchandisers to carry the\
  \ books.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
